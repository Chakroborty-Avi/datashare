# Datashare

**Datashare** is an open‚Äësource, self‚Äëhosted document search and analysis platform built by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ). It ingests heterogeneous data (PDFs, emails, spreadsheets, images, archives, etc.), extracts text (including via OCR), enriches it with metadata and named entities, and exposes everything through a powerful search UI and REST API. Because Datashare runs on your own machines, you keep full control over sensitive material‚Äîno external cloud services required.

## Main Features

* üîç **Full‚Äëtext search**: Index & query PDFs, emails, office docs, images, archives, and more.
* üñºÔ∏è **OCR on scans & images**: Turn visual text into searchable text.
* üß† **Named‚Äëentity extraction**: Auto-detect people, orgs, locations, emails, etc.
* ‚≠ê **Stars & tags**: Mark and organize key documents.
* üß∞ **Advanced filters & operators**: Combine facets with boolean, wildcard, and fuzzy queries.
* ü§ù **Team/server mode**: Multi-user deployment with shared tags and recommendations.
* üîå **Plugin architecture**: Extend Datashare with custom modules.

## Developer Guide

This section explains how to set up a development environment, build the project, run tests, and manage database migrations. It assumes you are comfortable with Java/Maven projects and basic service orchestration.

### Requirements

**Languages & tooling**

* **JDK 17** (or 11 if you are on an older branch): use SDKMAN!/asdf to keep versions tidy
* **Apache Maven 3.8+**: primary build tool for the backend
* **GNU Make** (optional but recommended): convenient shortcuts (`make dist`, `make update-db`, etc.)

**Services**

Those services must be running to have a complete developer environement. You might want 

* **PostgreSQL 13+**
  * Available on host `postgres:5432`
  * Two DBs expected by default: `datashare` (dev) and `test` (tests)
  * A role with privileges, e.g. user: `test`, password: `test`
* **Elasticsearch 7.x** 
  * Available on host `elasticsearch:9200`
  * 8.x is not officially supported 
* **Redis 5+**
  * Available on host `redis:6379`
  * Used to store session and orchestrate async tasks.

### Build

The project is modular. Typical steps:

```bash
# 1. Validate the build and resolve deps
mvn validate

# 2. Build shared testing utilities (some modules depend on these)
mvn -pl commons-test -am install

# 3. Apply DB migrations so your dev DB schema matches the code
mvn -pl datashare-db liquibase:update

# 4. Build everything (excluding tests)
mvn package -Dmaven.test.skip=true
```

### Run Tests

Datashare has both unit and integration tests. Integration tests expect Postgres, Elasticsearch, and Redis to be reachable.

```bash
# Run the whole test suite
mvn test

# Or run a single module
mvn -pl datashare-api test

# Or a single test class
mvn -pl datashare-api -Dtest=org.icij.datashare.PropertiesProviderTest test
```

### Database Migrations

Datashare uses **Liquibase** to version and apply schema changes.

**Apply latest migrations:**

```bash
make update-db
```

**Start from scratch (danger: drops data):**

```bash
bash datashare-db/scr/reset_datashare_db.sh
mvn -pl datashare-db liquibase:update
```

**Adding a new changeset:**

1. Create a new XML/YAML changeset under `datashare-db/src/main/resources/db/changelog/`
2. Reference it in the master changelog file
3. Run `make update-db` locally to verify
4. Commit both the changeset and updated master file

## Frontend

The web UI is built with Vue 3 and maintained in a [separate repository](https://github.com/ICIJ/datashare-client). When building the backend, you must also build the client and copy its compiled files into the `./app` directory. The backend bundles these static assets using [FluentHTTP](https://github.com/CodeStory/fluent-http), which serves resources from `./app` (relative to the repo root). If this folder is missing or empty, only the API will be available, no UI.

### Prerequisites for Frontend Dev

* **Node.js 20.19+**
* **Yarn 1**

### Build workflow

1. **Clone & enter the client repo**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ICIJ/datashare-client.git
   cd datashare-client
   ```
2. **Install and build**

   ```bash
   yarn
   yarn build
   ```

   The build outputs a production bundle into `dist/`.
3. **Copy (or symlink) into backend**

   ```bash
   rm -rf ../datashare/app
   mkdir -p ../datashare/app
   cp -r dist/* ../datashare/app/
   ```
